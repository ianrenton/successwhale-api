Get Columns
-----------

Returns the list of columns (`columns`) that the current user has set up in SuccessWhale. This is an array with one element for each column. Each element itself consists of a sub-array (`sources`) of one or more sources that is pulled into that column, a complete 'feed path' that should be provided to the [Get Feed](feed-get.md) call in order to retrieve data for that column (`fullpath`), and a 'friendly' autogenerated title (`title`) that clients can use for display. Each source in the `sources` array is a hash which contains five items: the service the feed comes from (`service`) e.g. Twitter, the user ID to access that service as (`uid`), the username for the client to display when referring to that user ID (`username`), the URL of the feed relative to the base URL of the service (`shorturl`) e.g. "statuses/home_timeline", and the longer URL of the feed (`fullurl`) - this is the URL used by the [Get Feed](feed-get.md) call that combines the `service`, `uid` and `shorturl`.
